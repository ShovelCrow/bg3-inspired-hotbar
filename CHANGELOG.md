## [3.4.1] - 2025-08-08
### Fixed
- **Active Effects** - Fixed active effects not re-enabling or able to be deleted if disabled

## [3.4.0] - 2025-08-07
### Added
- **Container Popovers** - Add bags, pouches, and other containers options to your hotbar to open them in a popover window showing their contents. Items in the container can be moved around the popover, but other features and items should not be placed here if they don't belong to the container itself

### Reworked
- **Target Selector** - Refactored, changed UI/UX, added keybindings for accept and roll (default Enter), added setting for skipping if target already selected (Issue: [#226 & #234])

### Fixed
- **Hotbar Auto-Update** - Items now automatically appear in hotbars when given to any character, even if their token and therefor hotbar isn't currently selected. Giving items to un/linked NPCs for example
- **Consumable Items** - Potions, scrolls, and other consumables now properly auto-populate to hotbars with autopopulate feature
- **Actor Duplication** - Duplicated actors now correctly reference their own items instead of the original actor's items when the hotbar is not already rendered (Issue: [#228])
- **Drag Bar Movement** - Fixed to move at the right speed with set scale
- **Common Actions Bug** - Common Actions would sometimes duplicate when the container was empty but the features were on the sheet and then the token was placed on the canvas again

## [3.3.1] - 2025-07-31
### Fixed
 - **Passive Features Auto-Populate** - NPCs should autopopulate their passive features when toekn is created. This function was lost in last update(s).
 - **Annoying Console Log** - Oops. Forgot to remove it.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-07-30
### Important
- **Foundry VTT v13 & D&D 5e v5.x Support** - This release officially supports Foundry VTT v13 and D&D 5e v5.0.4+. Updates for Foundry VTT v12 will cease with this release. Users on v12 can continue using v3.2.6 as the final v12-compatible release.

### Added
- **NPC Container Defaults Setting** - Added new setting "NPCs Use Container Defaults" that allows NPCs (linked or unlinked) to ignore weapon sets and use container auto-populate defaults instead. This provides more flexibility for NPC hotbar organization.

### Fixed
- **Passive Features Detection** - Fixed issue where active abilities (actions, bonus actions, reactions) were incorrectly appearing in the passive features bar. Now only truly passive features are displayed.
- **Passive Container Display** - Fixed issue where all available passive features were displayed when none were selected. Now the passive container shows no features when none are selected, while maintaining the invisible tab functionality for right-click configuration access.
- **Target Selector** - Complete rewrite of target selector logic for D&D 5e v5.x compatibility. Target selector now properly integrates with Foundry's activity system, allowing normal activity selection followed by intelligent target selection only when needed. Updated to use v13's new targeting API (`canvas.tokens.setTargets`) and scene controls API (`ui.controls.render`).
- **Auto-Population** - Fixed auto-population features to correctly detect items with activities using D&D5e v5.x Map-based activities structure instead of the old array-based structure.


## [3.2.6] - 2025-07-09
### Fixed
- **Target Selector (Beta)**
  - **Target Selector Range Calculation** - Fixed range calculation to use proper edge-to-edge distance measurement instead of center-to-center.
  - **Target Selector Right-Click** - Improved right-click behavior to only confirm target selection if mouse hasn't been dragged (allows camera panning without accidental target confirmation).

### Features
- **Target Selector (Beta)**
    - **Target Selector Keybindings** - Added `[` and `]` keybinds for decreasing/increasing target count during targeting. Configurable in Foundry's keybind settings under "BG3 Inspired Hotbar" section.
    - **Range Indicator Customization** - Added three new settings for range indicator appearance:
      - **Range Indicator Shape**: Choose between circle or square indicators (default: square)
      - **Range Indicator Animation**: Choose between pulsing or static indicators (default: pulse)
      - **Range Indicator Line Width**: Choose line thickness from 1-4px (default: 2px)
    - **Settings Organization** - Reorganized all Target Selector settings into logical order: Enable → Range Checking → Range Indicators → Shape → Animation → Line Width → Auto-Target Self.

## [3.2.5] - 2025-07-08
### Fixed
- **Passive Features Classification** - Fixed issue where active abilities (actions, bonus actions, reactions) were incorrectly appearing in the passive features bar. Updated the classification logic to only include feats that are explicitly marked as passive or have no activation capabilities. (Related Issue: [#220])
- **Auto-Sort Spell Level Ordering** - Fixed critical bugs in the auto-sort functionality where spells were not sorting correctly by level. The fallback logic was incorrectly defaulting all spells to level 99 instead of their actual spell levels. Now spells properly sort from cantrips (level 0) through 9th level spells with alphabetical sub-sorting within each level. (Related Issue: [#211])
- **Passive Features Bar Hiding** - Added ability to completely empty the passive features bar by unchecking all features in the configuration dialog. Previously, when no features were selected, all available passive features would be displayed. Now an empty selection results in an empty (but still interactive) container. (Related Issue: [#205])
- **Spell Tooltips Compatibility** - Fixed issue where spell tooltips were not working for users on D&D 5e system v3.x. The macro tooltip implementation was using a hook-based approach that failed with older system versions. Reverted to the v3.1.3 approach using direct prototype extension for better cross-version compatibility. (Related Issue: [#209])
- **Portrait Toggle Logic** - Fixed the "Hide Portrait Image" setting working backwards. (Related Issue: [#204])
  > **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** If your portraits are suddenly hidden after this update, check your **"Hide Portrait Image"** setting in the module configuration. Due to the previous backwards logic, this setting was enabled by default and many users may have it toggled on. **Disable this setting** to show portraits again. At the top, you can change this setting for all users simultaneously if you are the gamemaster.
- **Auto-Populate Container Selection** - Fixed issue where newly added items (e.g., potions, scrolls) were always defaulting to container 1 instead of respecting the configured container settings. The `_findAppropriateContainer` method in `ItemUpdateManager.js` now properly handles consumable subtypes when determining which container should receive new items. For example, if potions are configured for container 3, new potions will now correctly auto-populate there instead of defaulting to container 1.

### Features
- **Extended Auto-Populate Options** - Replaced the blanket "Consumables" option with individual consumable subtype chips: Potions, Scrolls, Ammunition, Food & Drink, Wands, Rods, Poisons, and Trinkets. The feature includes automatic migration for existing users - any containers previously set to "Consumables" will be updated to show "Potions" and "Scrolls" by default. (Related Issue: [#21])

## [3.2.4] - 2025-07-07
### Fixed
- Version 3.2.3 was not pointing to 3.2.3 manifest, so had to release a new version to keep installs clean.

## [3.2.3] - 2025-07-07
### Fixed
- **Show Secrets Module Compatibility** - Fixed compatibility issue with Show Secrets module by properly passing enrichment options through libWrapper and correcting module name registration. Thanks to @kaelad02 (Show Secrets module developer) for identifying the issue and providing the fix. (Related Issue: [#219])

## [3.2.2] - 2025-07-04
### Fixed
- **Target Selector (Beta)** - Fixed issue where AOE spells and abilities with templates (like Fireball, Cone of Cold, etc.) were incorrectly using the target selector instead of Foundry's native template placement system. Now only creature-targeted spells use the target selector, while AOE spells that place templates (cone, cube, cylinder, line, radius, sphere) use the standard template placement.

## [3.2.1] - 2025-07-04
### Fixed
- **Target Selector (Beta)** - Fixed issue where healing spells (like Healing Word, Mass Healing Word, Cure Wounds) were not applying healing when using the target selector. The target selector was clearing selected targets too quickly, preventing MidiQoL from properly detecting and applying the healing effects. Now targets are maintained during spell execution with a small delay before clearing.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-07-04
### Features (Beta)
- **Target Selector System** - Added interactive target selection for spells and abilities inspired by Argon Combat HUD. When enabled, clicking items that require targeting will show a crosshair cursor and allow you to select targets on the canvas with visual feedback.
  - **Visual Feedback**: Crosshair cursor, range indicators, and target count display
  - **Range Validation**: D&D 5e grid-based distance calculation with visual range circles
  - **Multi-targeting**: Support for spells that can target multiple creatures (e.g., Aid, Magic Missile)
  - **Dynamic Target Adjustment**: Use `[` and `]` keys during targeting to increase/decrease target count for spells that scale with level (e.g., Eldritch Blast at higher levels)
  - **Settings**: Dedicated "Target Selector settings" section with options to enable/disable the system, range indicators, auto-targeting, and range checking
  - **⚠️ Beta Warning**: This feature is in beta and requires more testing. If you encounter issues or prefer not to use it, you can disable it in the Target Selector settings.

## [3.1.6] - 2025-07-04
### Features
- Split "Show Rest/Turn buttons" setting into granular dropdown control with options: "Show Both (Rest & Turn)", "Show Rest Only", "Show Turn Only", and "Show Neither". This allows GMs to show the End Turn button to players without showing rest buttons, giving more precise control over which buttons are visible. (Related Issue: [#213])

## [3.1.5] - 2025-07-04
### Features
- Add toggle button to switch between GM Hotbar and Token Hotbar when GM Hotbar is enabled. It's above the row controls buttons on the far right. (Related Issues: [#212], PR [#215] - Thanks @gubacelar!)
- Extend action type filters to search activities - items with activities now highlight when their activity action types match the selected filter. (PR [#208] - Thanks @kgsherman!)

## [3.1.4] - 2025-05-22 
### Disclaimer
- To improve performances and avoid bugs, Auto-equip items feature will now only look for items found in weapons sets, any other items will be ignored. This way, it allows you to manually equip items and still switch between your sets without having those manually equipped to be unequipped (as long as they are not in a weapon set).
