# BG3 Inspired HUD

A Foundry VTT module that reimagines the hotbar interface with a design inspired by Baldur's Gate 3. It provides a persistent, token-specific interface for managing abilities, spells, and effects with modern UI/UX principles.

**Please check the Settings menu in Foundry VTT for options such as auto-populating actions for unlinked tokens, opacity adjustments, and fade out settings.**

Coffee helps me stay up to 2am to write these modules. Thank you for the lack of sleep in advance!
